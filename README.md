## What is Pathogen?

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/NrmRn50/pathogen.jpg" >

Pathogen(PATH) is a token that creates exposure to a set of consensus agreed tokens' liquidity pools to operate as a staking mechanism to not only add liquidity to those pools but reap the reward benefits that are accrued per transactions of the corresponding tokens of those pools.</p>

Initial supply circulation: </p>
- 10,000,000 PATH tokens
- 10,000,000 ANTI tokens
- 10,000,000 NITRO tokens
- 10,000,000 SOMA tokens
- 10,000,000 FRSH tokens
- 10,000,000 VIRAL tokens </p>

Price of each token: $1.00</p>

Total Value Locked(TVL) for each token: $10,000,000</p>

## Tokenomics
</p>
The five tokens Pathogen is staking to is: Antigen(ANTI), Nitrotoken(NITRO), Soma(SOMA), Freshtoken(FRSH), and Viraltoken(VIRAL). All based within the Ethereum network, each of these tokens have a TVL(Total Value Locked) fixed liquidity pool of $10,000,000. Every transaction that takes place by all token owners of it's respected staked token gives a reward to the liquidity provider(PATH) of 0.02% per transaction, maxing at 1% total, which is rewarded after a 24 hour period.</p>
 - Example: Token owner has SOMA staked in the liquidity pool. All token holders of SOMA who execute transactions with SOMA will generate a 1% reward for the liquidity provider. </p>
Pathogen is initially broken up into 20% per token to stake, based on how much the investor owns. </p>
 - Example: If a user owns 100 tokens, it will utilize those 100 tokens and stake 20% into each liquidity pool. That 100 coins represents 0.01% of the circulating tokens. </p>
The Pathogen Trust has a $1,000,000 stake in each one of these liquidity pools, representing 10% of each pool, equaling a total of $5,000,000 staked. Since Pathogen does not represent the associated tokens' liquidity pools, based on how many tokens the user owns, is the exposure to the Pathogen Trust's stake in each pool. This will help on saving gas so no conversion between coins needs to take place(PATH <-> ANTI). </p>
- Example: User owns 100 tokens, totaling $100 worth of PATH tokens. This means that $100 represents of one pool at 0.01% of a single pool(100/1000000), * 5(all the pools) represents 0.002% of the total staked. </p>
After a 24 hour period, those rewards remain within the liquidity pool but will also reward the user with additional PATH tokens as a form of elasticity, delegated based on amount of tokens owned. </p>
- Example: User owns 100 tokens. All 5 pools had 100 transactions. 100 transactions = 2% total of one liquidty pool. 100 transactions * 5 pools = 500 transactions total in one day. 2%(one pool's 100 transactions rewards for one day) * 5 pools = 10% accumulative total reward for one day. Each 2% will remain in the liquidity pools, but will represent as a reward to the token holder. 10% * the amount of current value of the user's ownership of the entire token supply(0.01%) = 0.01 tokens as a reward for being a token holder. The token holder after 24 hours will now have 100.01 tokens.
